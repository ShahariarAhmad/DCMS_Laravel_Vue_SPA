My main project is DCMS ...

Link: [DCMS_Laravel](https://github.com/ShahariarAhmad/DCMS_Laravel)



This current repository is basically a small portion of the original DCMS. I just wanted to learn & practice Vue Js without wasting time in creating another brand new projects. 



To understand how DCMS work and which action does what and leads to where, please read Main DCMS Basic Documentation. 





Few lacking in this app that is intentional.

* No from validation implemented . Because I didn't wanted to waste time doing thing that I already know. 
* Not 100% responsive. Because I didn't wanted to waste my time making is responsive. Already know how to do it with Tailwind & Bootstrap. 
* But in dummy project like this one I don't maintain clean coding because it require more time that I don't want to spend in a dummy project. Learning is the only purpose this dummy project serves. But I write clean code in production.
