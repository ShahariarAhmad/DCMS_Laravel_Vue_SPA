My main project is DCMS ...

Link: [DCMS_Laravel](https://github.com/ShahariarAhmad/DCMS_Laravel)



This current repository is basically a tiny portion of the original DCMS. I just wanted to learn & practice Vue Js without wasting time creating brand new projects. 



To understand how DCMS works and which action leads to where, please read Main DCMS Basic Documentation.




Few lacking in this app that is intentional.

* No form validation implemented. Because I didn't want to waste time doing things that I already knew. 
* Not 100% responsive. Because I didn't want to waste my time making it responsive. Already know how to do it with Tailwind & Bootstrap. 
* But in a dummy project like this one, I don't maintain clean coding. Learning is the only purpose this dummy project has. **But I write clean code in production**. 






How to run this project?

Step: 1

- Make sure you have node, and composer installed. 
- You can use any local server.

Step: 2

Inside the project, folder run these commands

* npm install
* composer update
* run 'npm run dev' and 'php artisan serve'



Note: 

* App URL in .ENV file must include the port number. ( Eg.  http://localhost:8000 ) .... **Without this Resource links will be broken**. 
* I refractor this git repo & fix bugs whenever I get some free time.
